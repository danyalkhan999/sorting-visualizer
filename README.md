# [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer-a93c4.web.app/)

This is a fully responsive, interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built with React. The application allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms such as **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**, **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Insertion Sort**. The visualizer offers a smooth and intuitive interface, enabling users to control the speed of the animations, adjust the array size, and observe the step-by-step process of how sorting algorithms work.

The project has been deployed using Firebase and can be accessed on both desktop and mobile devices.
## Features

- **Six Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Adjust array size
  - Control sorting speed
  - Shuffle the array for random starting conditions
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Fully mobile-friendly interface for seamless usage on any device
- **Real-Time Visualization**:
  - Visualize the sorting process with color-coded transitions


## Installation

1. **Clone Project**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/danyalkhan999/sorting-visualizer
  cd sorting-visualizer
```
2. **Run Project**

```bash
    npm run dev
```

## Algorithms

1. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller subarrays and merges them back together in sorted order.
2. **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into smaller subarrays based on a pivot, then recursively sorts them.
3. **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based algorithm that builds a heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
4. **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
5. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the array into a sorted and unsorted part, repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part.
6. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
## Technology Used

+ **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
+ **CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
+ **Firebase:** For deployment and hosting.
